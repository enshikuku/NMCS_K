        <h2 class="aboutTitles">Brief History about NMCS-K</h2>
        <p>NMCS-Kenya first began as <strong>International Movement of Catholic Students (IMCS)</strong> which was accredited in 1921 in Fribourg Switzerland under the name <strong>PAX ROMANA</strong>. <strong>IMCS-PAX ROMANA</strong> is the successor to the international union of catholic students in Fribourg Switzerland. It was approved by a letter from cardinal Gasparri to Max Gressly president of the International Union of Catholic Students on 5th June 1921. Because of its powerful witness to reconciliation and solidarity under the motto of <strong>‘PAX CHRISTI IN REGNO CHRISTI’</strong> the union began to be known as <strong>“Pax Romana”</strong>. Thus IMCS-PAX ROMANA as an organization of the student apostolate is a federation of national movements and associations of catholic student in higher education, without prejudice to their autonomy. In Kenya, the movement was established in the year 1995 at Kenyatta University from where it spread to other tertiary institutions. <br> Later on in Kenya, the movement changed its name officially to <strong>PAX ROMANA-NATIONAL MOVEMENT OF CATHOLIC STUDENTS-KENYA.</strong>. The national secretariat of NMCS Kenya is based at the <strong>Kenya National Catholic Youth Centre</strong> at <strong>Mji wa Furaha</strong>, Nairobi</p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitles">Activities and Events</h3>
        <p>As a movement, we take part in various activities at chapter level and also at National level. Most of our activities are charity-driven. As a movement, we have adopted more than 15 children nation wide and they are under the care of the respective chapters. To support the children, chapters often organise fund drives to raise money for school fees for the children. Apart from that, our members also take part in tree planting and environmental conservation. Above all, at the end of the day we all come together to pray and fellowship. Our events are mostly organized by the National council (National Executive and the chapter representatives).  There are about four national events that are organized every year by the National office.</p>
